### About ViteJS
Vite is a build tool that lets you configure a development environment for Vue, TezJS and React frameworks and integrate it with other back-ends. In addition, it also supports Server-side Rendering (SSR).

This project primarily uses ViteJS to set up a development environment for our project based on React framework.
